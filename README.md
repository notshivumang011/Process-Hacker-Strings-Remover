# 🚀 Process Hacker Strings Remover  



## 📌 Introduction  

**Process Hacker Strings Remover** is a dedicated utility built to clean or replace predefined strings from the **Process Hacker** binary.  
Process Hacker is a widely known open-source tool used by developers, researchers, and security enthusiasts for process monitoring and debugging. However, due to its popularity, many detection systems identify it by its unique string signatures.  

This tool helps in **removing those identifiable strings** while keeping the binary functional, making it suitable for research, learning, and controlled environments.
